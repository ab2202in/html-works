>>>>> A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. <<<<<<



>>>>> Do today's duty, fight today's temptation; do not weaken and distract yourself by looking forward to things you cannot see, and could not understand if you saw them. Do today what should be done. Your tomorrow may never come. Today is the pupil of yesterday. <<<<<<
